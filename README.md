# Binkw32 Autopatchers for Mass Effect 2 and 3

*Original ME3 Autopatcher created by [Warranty Voider](https://github.com/zeroKilo)*

Features:
- Enables in-engine console (default keys: TAB, Tilde);
- Validates all DLC's;
- ME3: bypasses SSL certificate check (needed for connection with [ME3 Private Server Emulator](https://github.com/PrivateServerEmulator/ME3PSE)).

Tested on: Mass Effect 2 (1.02; Steam and Origin), Mass Effect 3 (Demo and 1.5)

-----------------------------------------------------------

Includes ASI loader - original code by listener ([XLiveLess](http://gtaforums.com/topic/388658-relgtaiv-xliveless/))<br />
The ASI loader allows for loading of DLL files without the need of a separate injector. These DLL files must be renamed to *.asi and put in the same folder of binkw32.dll or in a subfolder named "asi".
